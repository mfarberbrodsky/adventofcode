# Advent of Code 2020

This repository hosts my solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), using C++.

I'm not trying for the leaderboard. Instead, my goal this year is to get my hands dirty with C++ and become comfortable with its coding practices, writing readable, clear and optimal code (with respect to time complexity).

If you're participating in AoC this year, I recommend you don't look at my solutions before you've solved the puzzles on your own - you'd be ruining the fun! Though after you've finished, please take a look. I would love to hear if you have a more efficient solution, or a suggestion to improve my code.
